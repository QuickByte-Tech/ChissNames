# ChissNames
The original idea for this project was that it would be able to find patterns
in the new EY Chiss name components, such as the mode (as of the publishing of
Lesser Evil, no non-family components repeat). It would also have a search
feature and a text based user interface. Those features were never programmed.
Instead it will create Family, Chiss, and Core objects and store them in ArrayLists.
Project comes with .txt files of all known Chiss names as of the release of
Lesser Evil.
